# cie-pseudocode-compiler
This unofficial CIE Pseudocode Compiler is a transpiler for Cambridge International A-level Computer Science Pseudocode. It converts pseudocode into JavaScript, which can later be executed as a standalone `.js` script.

The full CIE Pseudocode guide can be found [here](https://learnlearn.uk/alevelcs/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/09/9608_PSEUDOCODE_GUIDE.pdf).

## How to use it
1. Clone this repository
2. Write your Pseudocode script in `script.pc`
3. Translate and run your pseudocode program with `npm start`

The program will translate your `script.pc` file into `compiled.js`, then run the new JavaScript code.
