# cie-pseudocode-compiler
CIE Pseudocode Compiler is a transpiler for Cambridge International A-level Computer Science Pseudocode. It converts pseudocode into TypeScript, which can later be executed as a standalone `.ts` script.

The full CIE Pseudocode guide can be found [here](https://learnlearn.uk/alevelcs/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/09/9608_PSEUDOCODE_GUIDE.pdf).

## How to use it
1. Clone this repository
2. Write your Pseudocode script in `script.pc`
3. Run index.js with `npm run`
4. Run the newly-generated `compiled.ts` script with `npm run play`
